1) In a study of the size of various computer systems, the random variabl eX, the number of files stored (in hundreds of thousands), is considered. These data are obtained: 7 7 4 5 9 9 4 12 8 1 8 7 3 13 2 1 17 7 12 5 6 2 1 13 14 10 2 4 9 11 3 5 12 6 10 7
- a) Assuming that past experience indicates that σ=5, find a 100(1−α)% confidence interval for the average number of files stored.
- b) Assuming nothing is known about σ, find a 100(1−α)% confidence interval for the average number of files stored.
- c) Assuming the number of files stored are approximately normally distributed, find 100(1−α)% confidence intervals for the variance and for the standard deviation.

2) It  is  thought  that  the  gas  mileage  obtained  by  a  particular  model  of  automobile will be higher if unleaded premium gasoline is used in the vehicle rather than regular unleaded gasoline. To gather evidence in this matter, 10 cars are randomly selected from the assembly line and tested using a specified brand of premium gasoline; 10 others are randomly selected and tested using the brand’s regular gasoline.  Tests are conducted under identical controlled conditions and gas mileages for both types of  gas  are  assumed  independent  and  (approximately)  normally  distributed. These data result: Premium: 22.4 21.7 24.5 23.4 21.6 23.3 22.4 21.6 24.8 20.0 and Regular: 17.7 14.8 19.6 19.6 12.1 14.8 15.4 12.6 14.0 12.2. 

- a) Assuming σ1=σ2, find a 100(1−α)% confidence interval for the difference of the true means.
- b) Assuming σ1!=σ2, find a 100(1−α)% confidence interval for the difference of the true means.
- c) Find a 100(1−α)% confidence interval for the ratio of the variances.
